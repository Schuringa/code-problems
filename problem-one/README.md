# Problem one

Write a simple script that accepts a single word and URL that then returns the number of instances the word is found at the destination URL.

## Info

Matching works by single exact word e.g if you search for the word 'other' it will only match 'other' on its own and not inside another word like 'bother'.

Matching is case insensitive
